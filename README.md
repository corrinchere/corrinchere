Hi, Iâ€™m Corrin, and this is the beginning of my tech experience. 

Iâ€™m interested in a front-end web development or email developer role where I can continue to grow my visual and technical skills in visually pleasing, technically efficient manner. 

Iâ€™m currently learning more advanced JavaScript as well as other frameworks and using more APIs. 

You can follow me on my #100DaysOfCode on twitter at @smitherines__ , and once each weekly project is finished, I will be posting here so you may follow along.
