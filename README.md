Hi, I'm Rin. I've got a passion for trying new things and a love for learning. 

I've been having a joy learning software engineering with an emphasis on Front-End development, and have recently started learning more frameworks and a backend language. 

What I'm learning right now: 
          REACT
          SQL

Projects I'm working on: 
          Hiking location finder app. 
          Email templates.
